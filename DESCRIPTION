Description: A sigmoidal quantile function estimator based on a newly defined 
    generalized expectile function. The generalized sigmoidal quantile function 
    can estimate quantiles beyond the range of the data, which is important for 
    certain applications given smaller sample sizes. The package is based on the 
    method introduced in Hutson (2024) <doi:10.1080/03610918.2022.2032161>.
